# Java-3D_Renderer_Test
This is my attempt to create a 3D renderer in pure Java using JFrame.

The purpose of this is for me to get used to coding a Java project and learn about 3D graphics at the same time.
I made and considered this project finished in August 2020.

The only feature is rendering predefined cube model and .obj models on a JFrame by drawing lines between vertices.
No texture, camera culling or z-buffer support.

This only uses JFrame and no external graphics library.
