# Java-3D_Renderer_Test
This is my attempt to create a 3D renderer in pure Java using JFrame.

# About
The purpose of this project is for me to get used to coding a Java project and learn about 3D graphics at the same time.

Its only feature is rendering the predefined cube model and .obj models on a JFrame by drawing lines between vertices.
No texture mapping, camera culling or z-buffering support.

This only uses JFrame and no external graphics library.

# Entry point
The entry point (*main* method) of this program is in the Display class at ***"3D Renderer/src/main/Display.java"***.

# Control inputs
The control inputs can be found at ***"3D Renderer/src/Key Binds.txt"***.
